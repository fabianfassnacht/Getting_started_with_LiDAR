### Master and Bachelor theses at the Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics group at FU Berlin

#### Overview
This document is meant to give an overview of the process of writing a Master or Bachelor thesis at the Remote Sensing group of FU Berlin. In order to write a thesis with us, you need to fulfill certain criteria which we will list below. Further, we would like you to fill out a short questionnaire so that we can understand where your interests lay and the time period within which you want to finish your thesis. 

Please take the time to read through the information below and then decide whether you think that writing the thesis with us sounds interesting to you.

#### Requirements for writing a thesis at the remote sensing group

To qualify for writing a thesis with us you will have to

 - Successfully completed at least one elective course offered by the remote sensing group at FU Berlin or at another university (e.g., ERASMUS) (in case of the Master career it is highly recommended to participate in the course "Research project 1" which is offered by the remote sensing group in most years)
 - Complete the RESEDA online course which you can find here: [Link to the RESEDA online course](https://remote-sensing-at-fu-berlin.github.io/RESEDA/)
 - Be willing to work with scripting languages such as R or Python
 - Be present at the institute at least 1 day per week 
 - Be working full time (Master students) or at least half-time (BSc students) on your thesis 

#### Topics offered at the Remote Sensing group at FU Berlin

While we occasionally supervise theses where the students suggested their own topics, by experience the supervision is more efficient if the students work on topics that are directly relevant for the ongoing research activities of the supervisors. We hence only in exceptional cases are willing to supervise self-selected topics. We, however, highly encourage students to also bring in own ideas to expand the topics suggested by the supervisors.

Our research group currently offers final theses topics related to the following fields:

 - Terrestrial and mobile laserscanning of forests (deriving information about trees, understory and forests using point cloud information)
 - Remote sensing of urban trees (remote sensing data include aerial photographs, airborne laserscanning, very high resolution satellite data) 
 - Fire regimes (satellite time series, remote-sensing based fire products)
 - Methods-oriented theses (trying out different machine and deep learning algorithms)

#### Process of writing a thesis at the Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics group of FU Berlin

To improve the experience of everyone involved in a thesis, we have come up with a streamlined process to make sure that the thesis can be finished within a reasonable time period and at the same time a high-quality supervision of the thesis can be guaranteed. Please also be aware that we have a maximum number of theses we can supervise in parallel. 

The process looks like this:

 1. Fill out Google form 
 2. Have a first meeting to discuss topics + provide reading materials (for general introduction material see also links at the end of this text)
 3.  Second meeting to fix the topic (latest 1 month after the first meeting) and students start prepare an exposé of their thesis
 4. Student hands in exposé (see below) and receive feedback within two weeks
 5. Once feedback has been give, students will have to register the thesis - the exact date depends on whether the students will collect own data or not: 

If data is being collected: 1 week after data collection has ended
If data is already there: Within one week after receiving feedback on the exposé

6. Students should hand in a first version of their thesis at around 3 weeks before the submission deadline if they want to receive feedback.
7. All students have to present their thesis at least once in the research colloquium of the Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics group. 

#### Exposé
The exposé should cover 2-3 pages and include the following:

 - Suggestions for title
 - Relevance of the topic
 - Research questions and/or hypotheses
 - Methodical approach
 - Data
 - Open questions
 - Time plan (Gantt-chart)
 - Literature list
